## Holidays & Travel

According to the Cyprus Mail, the Cyprus hotel workers’ union, PEO, has raised concerns over collective agreements in the industry not being upheld. The union warned that the return to normality for the hotel industry post-pandemic relies on respect for the rights of workers. The union has called for a joint effort to safeguard jobs and protect the rights of employees in the hotel industry. High levels of unemployment and decreased incomes due to the pandemic have highlighted the need for more robust protection mechanisms for hotel workers. The union has been negotiating with the hoteliers association to address these and other industry-wide concerns.
